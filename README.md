# Surface tests 

This repo is just a container for some tests and experiments with Surface 

It was started from the Phoenix Live mix command.
Actually, there's just one test page of interest (http://localhost:4000/test)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
