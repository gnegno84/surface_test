# Surface tests 

This repo is just a container for some tests and experiments with Surface 

It was started from the Phoenix Live mix command.
Actually, there are just two test pages of interest, one based on Surface (http://localhost:4000/test) and the other reproducing the same scenario using LiveView (http://localhost:4000/lv-test) 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
